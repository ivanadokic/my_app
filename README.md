# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover here:
* Ruby version
```ruby -v```

Before you install Rails, you should check to make sure that your system has the proper prerequisites installed. These include:

Ruby
SQLite3
Node.js
Yarn

Rails requires Ruby version 2.5.0 or later. If the version number returned is less than that number (such as 2.3.7, or 1.8.7), you'll need to install a fresh copy of Ruby.

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
